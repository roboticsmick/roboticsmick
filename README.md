<!-- HELLO WORLD -->
# Michael Venz ‚Äì Research Engineer in Marine Robotics üåäü§ñ

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Michael, a research engineer at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), working to advance marine robotics and conservation.

## About Me

I'm interested in developing autonomous underwater hyperspectral imaging systems for marine ecosystem monitoring. Combining AI, photogrammetry, and hyperspectral analysis to map reefs, identify species, and track ecosystem health.

Currently, I've been developing Rangerbot Mantis - an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with a comprehensive sensor suite including a Headwall hyperspectral camera, Ocean Optics spectrometer, Luxonis 4K stereo vision system, and full-spectrum LEDs for seafloor mapping. The system works alongside an autonomous surface vessel that captures environmental data like wind, salinity, and surface irradiance. This project, developed in collaboration with the University of Hawaii and Oceankind, aims to enable early detection of an invasive algae that's devastating coral reefs across Hawaii.

My goals are to work towards doin a PhD around underwater hyperspectral and photogrammetry digital twins, and to develop these technologies further. I'm always interested in learning from others working on similar challenges. If you're exploring ways to better understand or protect marine environments, I'd be keen to hear about your work!
