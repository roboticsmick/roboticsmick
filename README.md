<!-- HELLO WORLD -->
# Michael Venz ‚Äì Research Engineer in Marine Robotics üåäü§ñ

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Michael, a research engineer at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), working to advance marine robotics and conservation.

## About Me

My research is centered on employing underwater hyperspectral imaging via autonomous underwater vehicles, with a specific focus on detecting invasive marine species and enhancing species detection, to support marine conservation initiatives.

I‚Äôm keen to deepen my exploration of this vital field in the future via a PhD and always welcome collaborative and research opportunities.
