- 👋 Hello world! I’m Michael Venz, a 4th year Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronics) student at Queensland University of Technology, Australia.
- 👀 I love to research and design robotic and avionic systems in my spare time, with the goal of learning more about how these techniques can be applied to exploratory satellite and rover designs. I want to send a satellites and robots to every moon, planet, and asteroid in our system. I'm hoping to work in research.
- 🌱 I'm currently using Fusion360 for PCB design and modelling, Python (Dash) for simulations and plotting, and VSCode with PlatformIO (C++ and Python) for programming.
- 💞️ I’m an executive for QUT Aerospace Society and working on a low cost, open source, avionics systems for monitoring rocket flight data. I'm a member of Queensland Rocket Society, and have my L1 High Power Rocket certification from Tripoli."
